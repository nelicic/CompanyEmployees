This web API application is built on .NET 6, with an Onion Architecture. It uses Entity Framework as the ORM, and NLog for logging. Automapper is used for object mapping, while JWT and Refresh Tokens are used for Authorization and Authentication. Global error handling is implemented, as well as validation, filters, paging, searching, sorting, data shaping, and HATEOAS. The application also supports API versioning, caching, rate limiting, and throttling.
